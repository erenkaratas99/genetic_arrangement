# genetic_arrangement

50x50 Matrix has created with random numbers in the interval of [1,4].

Each number represents a specific nucleobase. 

1 ==> Adenin
2 ==> Guanine
3 ==> Cytosine
4 ==> Thymine

The program in this repository search for a specific gene arrangement of {2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2}. 
But gene arrangement can be changed easily. Therefore my code can be used for every arrangement with a little touch.

Program search the gene arrangement in matrix horizontally, and calculates the similarity.
